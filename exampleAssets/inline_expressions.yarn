// the place in a race for example - this will test ordinal format function
<<set $place = 2>>
// // the next few variables will be used in pluralisation testing
// // the number of apples I have
<<set $apples = ($place*3)^2>>

I participated in a [color=#ff00ff]race[/color] and [wave]came in [/wave] {$place}[ordinal {$place} one="st" two="nd" few="rd" other="th"] place. #line:2693a5e6
The tree only has [plural {$apples} one="one apple" other="% apples"]! #line:16a64e75

-> This is one option #line:7811acb5
    Interesting Choice #line:6cef1363
    -> this is another option #line:35381c14
    -> and another hahahahaha #line:25786333
    <<if true>>
        This is inside a nested if. #line:60d92bc2
    <<endif>>
-> this is an option with {3 * 3} inline expressions and [plural {1} one="one"] format function. #line:ec5405a9

<<wait 4>>
After this line there is a 4 second wait. #line:1d11c2b1 

This is another line with a comment at the end.  #line:2f76aae3 // this is some random comment
