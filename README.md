# Introduction

GD Yarn is an godot plugin that allows you to create rich and interactive dialogues using a simple markup language similar to twine. It is easy to get started writing simple scripts, but powerful enough to your games dialogue to the next level with branching narratives that can change based on the players actions.

GD yarn is an implementation of [YarnSpinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) completely written in gdscript. The project aims to be as feature complete as possible compared to the c# version but may forgo certain things in lieu of similar alternatives that make it blend better with the godot ecosystem.
